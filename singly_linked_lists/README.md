This project focuses on the implementation of singly linked lists in C programming. A singly linked list is a data structure composed of nodes, where each node holds a value and a reference (link) to the next node in the list. In this project, we will implement various operations on singly linked lists using C functions.

Files
0-print_list.c: This file contains a function print_list that prints all the elements of a linked list and returns the number of nodes. The function takes a pointer to the list's head node as a parameter.

1-list_len.c: In this file, you'll find a function list_len that calculates and returns the number of elements (nodes) in a linked list. The function also takes a pointer to the list's head node as an argument.

2-add_node.c: This file holds a function add_node that adds a new node at the beginning of a linked list. The function returns the address of the new node or NULL if it fails. It takes a double pointer to the head node and a string str as parameters.

3-add_node_end.c: The add_node_end function in this file adds a new node at the end of a linked list. It returns the address of the new node or NULL if the addition fails. Like before, it takes a double pointer to the head node and a string str as parameters.

4-free_list.c: Here, you'll find the free_list function that frees all the nodes of a linked list. It takes a pointer to the head node as an argument.

Usage
These functions allow you to work with singly linked lists in your C programs. You can use them to create, modify, and manage linked lists efficiently. Just include the relevant header files and call these functions as needed to perform various operations on your linked lists.

Remember to check the specific requirements for each function and its parameters, as mentioned in the project instructions. These functions can be utilized to build more complex data structures and algorithms that require linked list operations.
